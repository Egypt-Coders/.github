# Alx Egypt

Welcome to the Alx Egypt organization on GitHub! Our mission is to help new programmers learn and to make the source code of our open source projects available to the community.



## About Us

<img src="media/about.png" alt="Logo" width="939" height="200">

Alx Egypt is owned by the staff team of the Discord server Alx Egypt. We are a group of developers who are passionate about programming and want to help others learn and grow in this field. Our organization is open to anyone who shares our passion for programming and is interested in contributing to our projects.

We believe that programming is a powerful tool for solving problems and creating innovative solutions. We also recognize that many people face barriers to learning programming, such as lack of access to resources or mentorship. That's why we started Alx Egypt - to provide a welcoming community and resources for anyone who wants to learn programming.



## Projects

We encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to our projects to get in touch with us. You can check out our repositories [here](https://github.com/orgs/Egypt-Coders/repositories).



## Community

At Alx Egypt, we believe that programming is best learned in a collaborative and supportive environment. That's why we have a vibrant community on Discord where members can ask for help, share resources, and collaborate on projects. Our community is open to anyone who is interested in programming, regardless of their level of experience.

We also organize regular events and workshops to help our members develop their skills and connect with other programmers. Some of our past events include hackathons, coding challenges, and guest talks from industry professionals.
